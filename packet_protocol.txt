============================= BOXCHAT PROTOCOL =============================

chat_message: Standard chat message
{
	from: user.displayName,
	message: [string with message (check for max length)],
	datetime: [global date&time]
}

chat_aux: Auxillary information for chatting, such as "user typing".
	Can also specify a color for the message
{
	from: user.displayName,
	type: [one of CHAT_AUX_TYPE's members],
	message: [information]
}

user_status: Used for updating users' statuses, such as when a user
	disconnects or connects (or even goes idle -- this idea needs
	some thought before being implemented though *privacy concerns*)
{
	user: user.displayName,
	connected: true/false,
	status: [one of USER_STATUS's members],
}

ketchup: When a user logs in, they need the current session's messages
	so that they know what everybody else is talking about. This is
	actually just an array of <chat_message>s. *In the future, consider
	sending the user <= a fixed number of messages, and if they scroll
	up, request more from the server. For now, we can send the user
	all of the messages, though
[ {chat_message}, {chat_message}, {chat_message}, ... ]
